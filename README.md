In this repository, we provide the code for RadlER, a novel solution to produce clean samples from data containing duplicates according to a target distribution.

We also provide the datasets used in our experimental evaluation, made available in the dedicated "datasets" folder.

You can find all details about deduplicated sampling on-demand and the RadlER framework in our <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol18/p2482-zecchini.pdf">research paper</a>, which will be presented jointly with the related demonstration at VLDB in London (September 1-5, 2025):
